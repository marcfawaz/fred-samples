General-purpose assistant ReAct agent — zero external dependencies.

Why this module exists:
- all other agents in this pod require external services (MCP, knowledge flow)
- this agent works with only a model configured; it is the minimal smoke-test
  for a running pod and the reference example for the BOOTSTRAP guide

How to use it:
- import `GENERAL_ASSISTANT_AGENT` and add it to a pod registry
- chat with it using `fred-agent-chat` without starting any other service

Example:
- `from fred_agents.general_assistant import GENERAL_ASSISTANT_AGENT`

from fred_sdk.contracts.models import ReActAgentDefinition, ReActPolicy


class GeneralAssistantDefinition(ReActAgentDefinition):

    Conversational ReAct agent with no tool dependencies.

    Why this class exists:
    - it is the simplest possible Fred agent: a system prompt and nothing else
    - it lets developers verify the pod, the model catalog, and the chat client
      work end-to-end without standing up any supporting service

    How to use it:
    - instantiate once and register it in the pod registry
    - extend with `declared_tool_refs` or `default_mcp_servers` when ready

    Example:
    - `definition = GeneralAssistantDefinition()`
